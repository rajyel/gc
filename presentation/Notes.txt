Heap
Heap space in Java is used for dynamic memory allocation for Java objects and JRE classes at the runtime 
 -Xms=1GB -Xmx=1GB
 
Stack Access to this memory is in Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) order
Variables exist as long as method that created them is running
Access to this memory is fast when compared to heap memory

Why does Java Stop?

The Heap reclaiming - Garbage collection

JLS - When an object is no longer referenced, it may be reclaimed by the garbage
collector.

“Stop-the-world” in the context of garbage collection means that all Java executing threads
are blocked or stopped from executing in Java code while the garbage collector frees up
memory as a result of finding Java objects no longer in use by the application.

Structure of Heap 
Young 
  Eden 
  Survivor 
Old Generation
Permanent / Metaspace 
XX:SurvivorRatio=6 sets the ratio between each survivor space and eden to be 1:6,  

Types of GCs

A young collection occurs when eden has filled up. The young collection moves all
objects out of eden: some are moved to one of the survivor spaces (S0 in this diagram)
and some are moved to the old generation





This GC aims to keep pause time to below 10ms whilst handling heaps of any size.
ZGC will be able to uncommit memory so it is available for the operating system again.
